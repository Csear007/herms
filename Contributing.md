## Definite feature plans

A lot of these are quite indepedent from each other. If one looks pretty fun to you, you could probably jump right in!

### Easy squeezy
- Import recipe file
- Optional caloric / nutritional information
- Add categories for recipes (I'm thinking of categories as simply lists of recipes... That way, recipes can be part of multiple categories and deleting a category doesn't break your recipes) 
- Make the output... prettier 
- Add better erroneous input handling
- Make yummy recipes and eat them

### May require elbow grease
- Use Brick (or a similar library) to make a more usable CLI
- Sort by tag
- Edit recipes
- Unit conversions
- Serving size adjustment
- Translation into languages other than English
- "One step at a time" mode

### Are you crazy?!
- Parse and store a recipe given a URL to allrecipes.com, food.com, etc.
- Show available recipes given a list of ingredients
- A pretty GUI!

## Ideas :: Maybe Features

## Other notes
- Rewriting out the entire recipe file minus a single recipe is fine for now, but will quickly become impractical when storing large numbers of recipes. We ought to find a better way of doing it! Unless I'm just crazy because even the most dedicated chefs might store only a few hundred recipes...
