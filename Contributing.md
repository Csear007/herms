## Development

#### TL;DR
[Install stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/). In the `herms` directory:
```
stack setup
stack build
stack exec herms
```
Whim-bam! 

## Definite feature plans

A lot of these are quite indepedent from each other. If one looks pretty fun to you, you could probably jump right in!

Once all of the **bolded** features are implemented, we're going to begin the proccess of uploading to Hackage!

### Easy squeezy
- Make yummy recipes and eat them

### May require elbow grease
- **Unit conversions**
- Optional caloric / nutritional information
- Translation into languages other than English
- "One step at a time" mode

### Are you crazy?!
- Parse and store a recipe given a URL to allrecipes.com, food.com, etc.
- Show available recipes given a list of ingredients
- A pretty (but optional) GUI!

## Known bugs

None at the moment!
